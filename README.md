# What we are trying to do:

We are trying to predict when and where the next mosquito that tests positive for the West Nile Virus will show up in the Chicago area.

We have been given data from two weather stations based near the airports in Chicago, when and where the city spray repellent, where the mosquito was caught, what species of mosquito was caught, and where the mosquitos were caught. 

# We plan to look at: 

* How long is the interval between sprays in one area?
* How does this time period effect the positive or negative result of mosquitos caught in the same trap?

# Out hypotheses are:

* If the area has been sprayed there will be fewer infected mosquitos.
* If the weather is hot and wet there will be more mosquitos caught and the possibility of infected mosquitos will increase.
* If the weather is hot and dry, cold and dry, or cold and wet fewer mosquitos will be caught and therefore there will be fewer mosquitos caught that are infected.
